# HackCamp2020
Our 2020 NwPlus HackCamp submission.

# Purpose:
During the Covid-19 pandemic, social distancing is essential to maintaining public health. As laws
surrounding public health change and become more restrictive, it's difficult to find safe public
outlets. This app is designed for users to find safe reccomendations where they can minimize contact
with others. In non-pandemic times, it's also useful for finding non-crowded places to study, or
restaurants that are not too busy if you're looking to eat as soon as possible.

# App Features:
* Search for coffee shops, restaurants, grocery stores, etc. by distance, busyness, and Google
rating.

* View each recommendations contact information (address, telephone number, etc).

* Give directions to your selected reccomendation via Google Maps.

* Be able to select maximum distance you're willing to travel.
